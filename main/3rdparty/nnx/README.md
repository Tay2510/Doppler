# nnx: experimental stuff for the 'nn' package.

The original neural network from Torch7, 'nn', contains stable and widely
used modules. 'nnx' contains more experimental, unproven modules, and
optimizations. Eventually, modules that become stable enough will make 
their way into 'nn' (some already have).

Disclaimer: DONT USE THIS PACKAGE WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING ITS MODULES !!!

## Requirements

* Torch7 (www.torch.ch)

## Installation

* Install Torch7 (refer to its own documentation).
* clone this project into dev directory of Torch7.
* Rebuild torch, it will include new projects too.

## Use the library

First run torch, and load nnx:

``` sh
$ torch
``` 

``` lua
> require 'nnx'
```

Once loaded, tab-completion will help you navigate through the
library (note that most function are added directly to nn):

``` lua
> nnx. + TAB
...
> nn. + TAB
```

In particular, it's good to verify that all modules provided pass their
tests:

``` lua
> nnx.test_all()
> nnx.test_omp()
```
